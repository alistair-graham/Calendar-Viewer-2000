# Calendar Viewer 2000 ðŸš€

## Tech Stack
- React
- TypeScript
- Redux
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- Jest

## Overview
A responsive basic calendar that displays the weeks' events. It has a form which can be used to add new events to the calendar.
This is my solution to a technical test. Given more time, it would look a lot different!

## Features
- Seamlessly responsive with three breakpoints.
- Built to be accessible by screen readers.
- Can add multiple events to one timeslot.
- Form validation if you have not completed all of the fields.
- An event's name is truncated if it is too long.

## Limitations
- Events are all one hour long and start on the hour.
- The event names are displayed on a single line.
- There is only one test and it is currently skipped as I haven't added the redux boilerplate to enable component testing.
